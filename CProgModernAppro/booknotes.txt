Thought since this book is a textbook I could just note bits and pieces in here not sure how the format will be or 
if it will get confusing idk just noting bits

    simple c programs take the form:

        directives
        int main(void){
            statements
        }
    
    -> flags for finding errors in programs
        -Wall       compiler produces warning messages when it detects possible errors (-W can be used and followed 
                    by codes for specific options -Wall means all options)
        -pedantic   issues all warnings required by c standard, causes programs using nonstandard features to be
                    rejected
        -ansi       turns off features of GCC that arent standard C and enables a few standard features that are 
                    normally disabled
        -std=c89
        -std=c99    specifies which version of c compiler should be used to check the program

        For example can be used in combination like 
            gcc -O -Wall -W -pedantic -ansi - std=c99 -o pun pun.c
    -> ending a float value with f (ex: 2.2f) will ensure it is saved as a float, if the f is not included then the value
        is usually stored as a double, doubles can be larger than floats.
