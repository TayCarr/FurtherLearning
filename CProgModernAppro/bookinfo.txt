Book, C Programming A Modern Approach 2nd
Author, K.N.King

--> Textbook, may not do ALL examples (especially since I just completed the basic book on C), 
    I did use this text in a class at uni so I have also done some of these.. If there is an exercise or something 
    that sticks out to me then I will include it but I will likely skip over the basics !
