this is my file for testing. 
It has a varity of lines and characters that I would like to be encrypted. I am not sure how many
lines there will be maybe 1, 2, 3, or even four. Who knows maybe more. As for how many characters 
there are to be in this file, I have no clue how many there will be. Probably not many, I will 
probably copy and paste these lines tbh in order to build up the file....

I didn't wanna download the entire frankenstein file... so just doing a basic little file with a mix
of lines and characters that is in english but not anything too crazy cause... ya....
