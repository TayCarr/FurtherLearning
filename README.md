# FurtherLearning
My journey to continue what I learnt in uni and maybe learn new things, as I do love these silly little books !!

I declared back in 2019, in my first semester I took one comp sci class and knew this was what I wanted to do. My school projects have been a bag of mixed beans and I never really found rhe one path I wanted to follow. So here I am still bouncing around hoping to land on something I love. That being said this will be a kind of sort of dump of the things I will be doing for this next little while maybe even further who knows. 

My schooling *includes*:
- python, as many start off with
- a tiny little bit of maple but I don't wanna talk about it... numerical methods hurt me deeply
- C, of course I hated it initially this being one of the times I was the motivated group member doing my best to get my group members to write a line any line to help.... but honestly it has grown on me especially after my operating systems class I now see it as the pretty little flower it is
- the previously mentioned OS class had me using the cairo library for graphing of various RR, SJF, FIFO and I kindly ask to not return to it 
- did a fun little scripting class using things like perl and bash, some others but I do not remember all the things we touched on tbh but I wouldn't mind refreshing this course tbh
- various pseudocode classes on algorithms and proofs and logics... this includes both comp sci based classes and math classes, I love love loved my intro to graph theory class and would like to review 
- continuing with math I have taken a handful of calculus classes and they are not my favourite... algebra I enjoy a lot more and abstract algebra was interesting but boy oh boy was it a tough class, I enjoy math so brushing up on this stuff I will hopefully get to
- there was a database class once with some sql and I think C# it was not my cup of tea 
- my software engineering class was ummm... I enjoyed my group but did I find it useful? not really.... did the project in Kotlin and it was meh 
- I enjoy cryptography and the special topics class I took on it was great the comp security class I took was over covid and lacked a sparkle being presented online and boy.... the networking class I took made me question wanting to go the cyber security route... the prof ,the projects ,the whole experience was just a bad time 
- I took a couple UxD classes thinking I may do a design minor and boring boring boring so much presenting too, being a comp sci student in a senior desn class my group members left the essay and report writing to me while they played with wireframes
- took a class in assembly RISC-V again rather not think about it 
- Computer graphics oh man, my baby *muah* I loved this class so much, you mean I get to apply my algebra knowledge in this !! my prof was the loveliest lady as well she was so great and she was so happy to have one female in the class, this was with javascript and webgl it was a difficult class but so rewarding 
- I did a web dev class where we used the MERN stack and it was pretty fun my group was enjoyable and the prof glazed our group and our project
- took and ethics and technology class... I needed another senior credit ok it was easy but so much essay writing
- MY CAPSTONE I again chose to go with the MERN stack for a web based tablet application where we worked with a design team and a researcher at the UofA to bring his games to life, the games being a learning aid for children with dyslexia and I really loved this project. I had to do a lot with MongoDB, React, CSS, the entire fullstack dev experience (well minus the design i thankfully had some great designers feeding me UXD)

So ya hopefully this will keep me motivated and have something to show, maybe it will spark a project idea :)
