My journey to show my years in university was not a waste

I declared back in 2019 and my final semester is quickly approaching. I used a Github account linked to my university email and now I am looking to update it, those school projects are honestly not necessarily a proud showing of my work. A mix of bad group members, my own disinterest and just the overall crush of juggling classes and work and everything in between... I would rather currate something I am proud of and dive further into interesting topics maybe even perhaps to show off to future potential employers. Maybe this is all for my sanity, a way to prove to myself that I have chosen the right path; whatever path that may be. I still do not know what exactly I want to go for but I am taking the fall semester off and taking my last three classes in the winter term. Between now and then is a lot of time and I don't want to regret wasting my time playing games and falling into a deep dark depression. I want to motivate myself and find joy in various code adventures. That being said this will be a kind of sort of dump of the things I will be doing for this next little while maybe even further who knows. 

To start I am one of those people that enjoys a good instructional paper-back book even a textbook or two. I am thinking these books, filled to the brim with excersises and other things that textbooks include, are a good launchpad into my attempt to stay sane and on track as I prepare for my capstone and *graduation*. 

My schooling *includes*:
- python, as many start off with
- a tiny little bit of maple but I don't wanna talk about it.
- C, of course I hated it initially this being one of the times I was the motivated group member doing my best to get my group members to write a line any line to help.... but honestly it has grown on me especially after my operating systems class I now see it as the pretty little flower it is
- the previously mentioned OS class had me using the cairo library for graphing of various RR, SJF, FIFO and I kindly ask to not return to it 
- did a fun little scripting class using things like perl and bash, some others but I do not remeber all the things we touched on tbh but I wouldn't mind refreshing this course tbh
- various pseudocode classes on algorithms and proofs and logics... this includes both comp sci based classes and math classes, I love love loved my intro to graph theory class and would like to review 
- continuing with math I have taken a handful of calculus classes and they are not my favourite... algebra I enjoy a lot more and abstract algebra was interesting but boy oh boy was it a tough class, I enjoy math so brushing up on this stuff I will hopefully get to
- there was a database class once with some sql and I think C# it was not my cup of tea 
- my software engineering class was ummm... I enjoyed my group but did I find it useful? not really.... did the project in Kotlin and it was meh 
- I enjoy cryptography and the special topics class I took on it was great the comp security class I took was over covid and lacked a sparkle being presented online and boy.... the networking class I took made me question wanting to go the cyber security route... the prof ,the projects ,the whole experience was just a bad time 
- I took a couple UxD classes thinking I may do a design minor and boring boring boring so much presenting too, being a comp sci student in a senior desn class my group members left the essay and report writing to me while they played with wireframes
- took a class in assembly RISC-V again rather not think about it 
- Computer graphics oh man, my baby *muah* I loved this class so much, you mean I get to apply my algebra knowledge in this !! my prof was the loveliest lady as well she was so great and she was so happy to have one female in the class, this was with javascript and webgl it was a difficult class but so rewarding 


So ya if I missed something I guess I will add, I will probably have a large folder monster emerge but I will attempt to maintain order who knows hopefully this will be fun. I guess will be just me talking to myself until I have to show this off to someone....
